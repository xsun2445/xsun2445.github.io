  abstract = {The fundamental bottleneck in adapting data-driven wireless solutions to real world is the lack of tools for augmenting good quality data which is environment-specific. Indeed, much of the data required for popular data-driven wireless communication and sensing systems requires domain expertise beyond the reach of an average consumer. This demo presents a radical new vision for generating synthetic data in consumer-specific environments by leveraging the power of modern compute.This demo presents a vision for consumer-facing wireless tools that can augment synthetic data for development and adaptation of data-driven wireless systems. Our solution leverages existing ray-tracing based wireless simulators in a new way to map and visualize the coverage in three key use-cases for this technology. Further, we motivate the need for development of such tools for generating synthetic data is vital towards a broader vision of foundational wireless models for data-driven wireless communication and sensing systems.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
