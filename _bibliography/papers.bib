abstract = {In this demonstration, in collaboration with licensed therapists, we introduce an AI therapist that takes advantage of the smart-home environment to screen day-to-day functioning and infer mental wellness of an occupant. Our system can assess a user's daily functioning and mental wellness based on a combination of direct conversation with users and information obtained from smart home devices using psychological rubrics proposed in [1]. We demonstrate that our system can converse with a user in a natural way (through a smartphone or smart speaker) and analyze a user's response semantically and sentimentally. In addition, we show that our system can provide preliminary interventions to help improve the user's wellness. In particular, when abnormal behavior is detected during the conversation or by smart home devices, the system provides psychotherapeutic consolations during the conversation and will check on the occupant's condition by actuating a home robot.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
