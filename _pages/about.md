Hi! I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/). I am a member of the [Networking and Emerging Wireless Technologies Lab (NEWT)](https://newtlab.ece.uw.edu/), studying under the supervision of Prof. [Akshay Gadre](https://www.akshaygadre.com/). 

I am passionate about solving exciting and impactful real-world challenges. Recently My research interest lies in Millimeter-Wave sensing and imaging system.

Prior to PhD, I received my Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University (2022) and had the honor working with Prof. [Fred Jiang](http://fredjiang.com/) at [Intelligent and Connected Systems Lab (ICSL)](http://icsl.ee.columbia.edu/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Automation Science and Engineering from South China University of Technology (2021).
